Whether you're looking to integrate your car inventory into an existing WordPress car dealer website, or would simply prefer to build your used/new car dealership website in WordPress, the MotorDesk plugin is the perfect solution.

== Installation ==

1. Once you have installed the MotorDesk plugin simply log-in to your WordPress administration panel and select the 'MotorDesk' link.

2. Select 'Connect MotorDesk' and log-in to your MotorDesk account, then confirm the connection.

3. Once connected go to the 'Pages' section in your WordPress administration panel and create a page to be used for your vehicle search results.  We recommend setting a permalink URL slug of 'vehicles', 'used-cars' or similar.

4. Add the [MOTORDESK] shortcode to the page content, and you're done!

5. Visit the page on your website and you will see your vehicle search form and vehicles, and when selected you will be taken to an information page for each vehicle.

6. When you're ready to customise your templates go to the plugin directory and duplicate the /template/ directory to be called /template_custom/, then modify the files in the /template_custom/ directory as you require - this will protect against your changes being overwritten when the plugin is updated.  Please ensure you maintain a separate backup of your /template_custom/ directory in case of upgrade failures.

7. Alternatively you can maintain the template files in another location in which case you can set the path to your templates directory below.

8. You can include the search form and latest vehicles in other pages of your website using the shortcodes [MOTORDESK-SEARCH] and [MOTORDESK-LATEST].
